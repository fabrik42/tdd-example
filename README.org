#+TITLE: TDD Example

* 🍿 Synopsis
This repository contains a minmal example of a test driven development approach.

The code is about the function called =validate_username(username)= that takes a string representing a username and will return a boolean value that indicates if the username is valid or not.
* 🛠 Setup
Install dependencies
=bundle install=

Watch files and run tests automatically
=bundle exec guard= (in base directory of repo)
* 🧘‍♀️ Best coding experience
Have multiple files/windows open at the same time:

- =./spec/validate_username_spec.rb= for the test code
- =./lib/validate_username.rb= for the implementation code
- Terminal running the =guard= test runner
* ♻️ Workflow
How to implement a new trait or feature:

1. Add a new description/expectation to the test file
2. See the test fail
3. Implement a solution in the code file
4. See test go green again
5. Repeat
