#+TITLE: TDD Example

* Run
Install dependencies
=bundle install=

Watch files and run tests automatically
=bundle exec guard= (in base directory of repo)
* Best experience
Have multiple files/windows open at the same time:

- =./spec/validate_username_spec.rb= for the test code
- =./lib/validate_username.rb= for the implementation code
- Terminal running the =guard= test runner
